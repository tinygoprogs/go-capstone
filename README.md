# Capstone bindings for Golang
Golang bindings for [capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/master/bindings).

Note that there is already [gapstone](https://github.com/knightsc/gapstone),
which is a more complete set of bindings, but it was too much of a binary size
overhead, thus I implemented a special purpose subset of bindings.
